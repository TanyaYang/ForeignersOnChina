					<p>The Communication University of China (CUC) is one of China's key universities of “Project 211”, directly administered by the Ministry of Education. CUC originated from what used to be a training center for technicians of the Central Broadcasting Bureau that was founded in 1954. In April 1959, the training center was upgraded to the Beijing Broadcasting Institute (BBI) approved by the State Council. In August 2004, BBI was renamed Communication University of China. </p>
					<p>The motto of the CUC is “integrity, professionalism, erudition and competence”.</p>
					<p>CUC upholds its principle of offering courses that are centered on science-based learning by emphasizing the application of a course and relevance to the particular discipline. As a result, an inter-relating and inter-influencing discipline system that covers journalism and communication, film & television arts, information science & technology, literature, engineering, management, economics, and law and science has been formed.</p>
